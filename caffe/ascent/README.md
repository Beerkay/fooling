This directory contains the necessary code to reproduce the gradient
ascent images in the paper: Figures 13, S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7. This
is research code, and so it may contain paths and such that are
particular to our setup.

The gist of the gradient ascent code
(along with a lot of experimental bookkeeping) is in the
[find_image](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling/blob/master/caffe/ascent/find_fooling_image.py#L68-L274)
function in find_fooling_image.py.

If you find any bugs, please submit a PR!

If you have any trouble getting the code to work, please get in touch, and we'll help where we can.
